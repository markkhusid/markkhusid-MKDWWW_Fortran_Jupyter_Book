    "The Fortran program `SOSdifference` is designed to calculate and display the difference between two mathematical quantities: the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the program works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Declaration**: The program begins by declaring the necessary variables:\n",
    "   - `i` and `n` are integers used for looping and setting the upper limit, respectively.\n",
    "   - `SumOfSqrs` and `SqrOfSums` are initialized to zero. They are used to store the sum of squares and the square of sums, respectively.\n",
    "   - `difference` is declared to store the computed difference between the two calculated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Interface Messages**: The program uses `write` statements to print messages to the user explaining what the program does. These messages are:\n",
    "   - \"This program calculates the difference between sum of squares and square of sums.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Input Handling**: Originally, the program likely had code to prompt the user to enter the value of `n` (number of terms). In this specific version, the user input is commented out, and `n` is set to 100 directly in the code. This adjustment might be for simplification, especially in environments like Jupyter Notebooks where interactive inputs can be cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Computation Loop**:\n",
    "   - The program uses a `do` loop from 1 to `n`. Inside this loop:\n",
    "     - It calculates the sum of squares (`SumOfSqrs`) by adding the square of each number `i` to the existing sum.\n",
    "     - It also calculates the sum of the numbers (`SqrOfSums`) by adding each number `i` to the cumulative sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Calculation**:\n",
    "   - After exiting the loop, it squares the total sum (`SqrOfSums`) to get the square of the sum of the numbers from 1 to `n`.\n",
    "   - It calculates the `difference` by subtracting the sum of squares from the square of sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Result Display**: Finally, the program prints the results:\n",
    "   - It displays the square of the sums.\n",
    "   - It displays the sum of the squares.\n",
    "   - It displays the computed difference between these two values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program highlights a classic mathematical problem often used to demonstrate algebraic identities or computational capabilities in programming."
