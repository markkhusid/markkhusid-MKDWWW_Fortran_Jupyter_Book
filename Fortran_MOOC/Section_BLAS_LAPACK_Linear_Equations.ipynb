    "### Explaining `generate_array.f90`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fortran program `generate_array.f90` serves to generate either a vector or a matrix with random elements, depending on the command line arguments provided. It uses routines from a module named `linalg_mod` to handle array creation and output. Below is an explanation of the program structure and its key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Module Usage**\n",
    "   - `iso_fortran_env`: Utilized for standard environment variables and constants, specifically `error_unit` for error messages and `DP` alias for `REAL64`, indicating double precision.\n",
    "   - `linalg_mod`: Externally defined module used here for `write_array` and `generate_random_array`, which handle array operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variable Declarations**\n",
    "   - `dimensions`: An allocatable integer array to store dimensions provided via command-line arguments.\n",
    "   - `vector`: An allocatable vector of type `real(kind=DP)`.\n",
    "   - `matrix`: An allocatable 2D array of type `real(kind=DP)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Execution Logic**\n",
    "   - It begins by fetching command-line arguments into `dimensions`.\n",
    "   - Based on the size of `dimensions`, it either generates a 1D vector or a 2D matrix:\n",
    "     - For a single dimension, a vector of random elements is created and written.\n",
    "     - For two dimensions, a matrix is created and written.\n",
    "   - If neither one nor two dimensions are provided, it outputs an error indicating that only rank 1 and 2 arrays are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**\n",
    "   - The program checks for proper memory allocation and command-line argument processing, with appropriate error messages and stops if any issues occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subroutine: `get_arguments`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Fetches command-line arguments to determine the size of the array to be generated.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Determines the number of arguments (`rank`).\n",
    "  - Allocates the `dimensions` array based on `rank`.\n",
    "  - Reads each command argument into `dimensions`, converting from string to integer.\n",
    "  - Handles errors in conversion and allocation, stopping the program if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Array Generation**: Depending on the input dimensions, it generates either a vector or a matrix with random values.\n",
    "- **Modular Design**: Leverages external modules for specific functionalities, which simplifies the main program.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: The ability to handle both vectors and matrices makes the program versatile for different kinds of numerical data generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- The program is executed with command-line arguments specifying the dimensions of the array to generate. For example:\n",
    "  - `./generate_array 10` would generate a vector of size 10.\n",
    "  - `./generate_array 3 4` would generate a 3x4 matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's move on to read and explain the `solve_equations.f90` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explaining `solve_equations.f90`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fortran program `solve_equations.f90` is designed to solve a system of linear equations using LAPACK's `dgesv` subroutine, which solves systems of linear equations \\( AX = B \\) by performing LU decomposition with partial pivoting. Here's a breakdown of its key components and functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Module Usage**\n",
    "   - `iso_fortran_env`: Standard intrinsic module providing access to the `error_unit` and `DP` (double precision kind type alias).\n",
    "   - `linalg_mod`: Custom module providing `read_array` and `write_array` functions, used to handle input/output operations for matrices and vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variable Declarations**\n",
    "   - `nr_eqns`: Number of equations in the system, derived from command-line arguments.\n",
    "   - `status`, `info`: Variables for checking statuses of operations; `info` is used specifically with `dgesv`.\n",
    "   - `matrix_file_name`, `vector_file_name`: File names for storing matrix \\( A \\) and vector \\( B \\).\n",
    "   - `b`: Vector \\( B \\) in the equation \\( AX = B \\).\n",
    "   - `pivot`: Integer array for pivot indices from the LU decomposition.\n",
    "   - `A`: Matrix \\( A \\) of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explicit Interface for `dgesv`**\n",
    "   - The subroutine's interface is explicitly defined to ensure correct passing of arguments:\n",
    "     - `n`, `nrhs`, `a`, `lda`, `ipiv`, `b`, `ldb`, and `info` describe the system dimensions, matrix and vector storage details, and output for status information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Main Execution Logic**\n",
    "   - **Argument Reading**: Fetches command-line arguments to determine the number of equations and file names for matrix \\( A \\) and vector \\( B \\).\n",
    "   - **Array Allocation**: Allocates memory for \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and pivot indices.\n",
    "   - **File Reading**: Reads matrix \\( A \\) and vector \\( B \\) from files specified by the user.\n",
    "   - **System Solving**: Calls `dgesv` to solve the linear system, where \\( A \\) is modified to store the factors from the LU decomposition, and \\( B \\) is overwritten with the solution \\( X \\).\n",
    "   - **Output**: Writes the solution vector \\( X \\) back to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**\n",
    "   - Checks for successful allocation and reading operations, with appropriate error messages and program termination on failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subroutine: `get_arguments`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Fetches and validates command-line arguments to ensure correct program setup.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `nr_eqns`: Number of equations/system size.\n",
    "  - `matrix_file_name`, `vector_file_name`: File paths for the matrix and vector data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear System Solver**: Uses `dgesv` for robust and efficient solving of linear systems, leveraging LAPACK's optimized routines.\n",
    "- **Modular File Handling**: Employs modular functions from `linalg_mod` for input/output operations, promoting code reuse and organization.\n",
    "- **Error Management**: Extensive error checking ensures the program gracefully handles common issues like invalid input or memory allocation failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The program is intended to be executed with three command-line arguments specifying the number of equations, matrix file name, and vector file name. For example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./solve_equations 3 matrix.dat vector.dat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would solve a 3x3 system of equations using matrix and vector data from `matrix.dat` and `vector.dat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's proceed to read and explain the `linalg_mod.f90` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explaining `linalg_mod.f90`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fortran module `linalg_mod.f90` provides utility functions for reading, writing, and generating arrays. This module likely supports the functionality required by the other programs you uploaded (`generate_array.f90` and `solve_equations.f90`). Here's a breakdown of its contents and functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Module Structure and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Module `linalg_mod`**\n",
    "   - Utilizes `iso_fortran_env` for standard environment definitions, such as `output_unit`, `error_unit`, and `DP` (double precision floating-point kind).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Functionality Exposed**\n",
    "   - `read_array`: Reads an array from a file whose dimensions and rank are defined by the inputs.\n",
    "   - `write_array`: Writes an array to a file or standard output, handling both vectors and matrices.\n",
    "   - `generate_random_array`: Fills an allocatable array with random numbers, based on the dimensions provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detailed Function Descriptions**\n",
    "   - **`read_array`**:\n",
    "     - Takes a file name, an array (allocatable), and its expected dimensions.\n",
    "     - Checks if the rank of the array matches the number of dimensions provided.\n",
    "     - Depending on the rank, it calls `read_vector` or `read_matrix` to perform the read operation.\n",
    "     - Errors are managed by stopping the program if the ranks or dimensions do not match expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`write_array`**:\n",
    "     - Accepts an array and an optional file name for output.\n",
    "     - Uses rank-specific procedures (`write_vector` or `write_matrix`) to handle the output based on the array's rank.\n",
    "     - If no file name is provided, the output is directed to the standard output (`output_unit`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`generate_random_array`**:\n",
    "     - Designed to allocate and populate an array (either vector or matrix) with random numbers.\n",
    "     - Checks the allocation status and initializes the array with random numbers using the intrinsic `random_number` procedure.\n",
    "     - Manages errors related to mismatched ranks or failed allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subroutines for Vector and Matrix Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`read_vector` and `write_vector`**:\n",
    "  - Handle reading and writing operations for vectors, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`read_matrix` and `write_matrix`**:\n",
    "  - Handle reading and writing operations for matrices, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functionalities and Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- The module is equipped to handle errors related to input/output operations and array manipulations, which is critical for robust numerical software.\n",
    "- Error messages are detailed, including specific issues like mismatched array ranks or failed memory allocations, which aids in debugging and user feedback.\n",
    "- Flexibility to output to either a file or standard output enhances the module's usability across different computational scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is utilized by other programs for managing arrays, particularly in numerical computations involving linear algebra. It abstracts away the details of file I/O and array initialization, allowing other parts of the software to focus on core computational logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, `linalg_mod.f90` serves as a foundational component for array management in Fortran programs, providing essential services such as reading, writing, and generating arrays with a focus on error handling and user feedback."
