    "The Fortran program `cold_front` is designed to calculate the change in temperature as a cold front moves over a given distance and time. The program uses a simple linear model to interpolate or extrapolate temperature changes based on the movement of the cold front. Here's a detailed explanation of each component and the underlying calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables:\n",
    "- `temp1` (12 degrees C): Initial temperature at the starting point.\n",
    "- `temp2` (24 degrees C): Initial temperature at a point 960 km away from the starting point.\n",
    "- `dx` (960 km): The distance between two points where the initial temperatures are measured.\n",
    "- `c` (20 km/hr): Speed of the cold front moving through the area.\n",
    "- `dt` (24 hours): Time period over which the temperature change is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation:\n",
    "- **Temperature Difference Calculation**:\n",
    "  - `temp2 - temp1` computes the temperature difference between the two points.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Temperature Change Rate**:\n",
    "  - `(temp2 - temp1) / dx` calculates the rate of temperature change per kilometer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Temperature Change Over Time**:\n",
    "  - `c * (temp2 - temp1) / dx * dt` computes the total temperature change over `dt` hours, considering the speed of the cold front. The term `c * dt` effectively calculates the distance covered by the cold front in `dt` hours. Multiplying this distance by the rate of temperature change per kilometer gives the total change in temperature over that distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result:\n",
    "- `res`: The resulting temperature after the cold front has moved for `dt` hours. The calculation `temp2 - c * (temp2 - temp1) / dx * dt` adjusts the initial temperature at `temp2` by the amount the temperature is expected to change due to the cold front's movement. The subtraction here is due to the interpretation that moving through the temperature gradient causes a decrease from the starting point at `temp2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "- The program prints the resulting temperature after `dt` hours, indicating how much the temperature has changed due to the cold front's progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified Formula Explanation:\n",
    "- The formula calculates how much the temperature decreases as the cold front moves from `temp2` towards `temp1`. This is based on the linear change in temperature over the distance `dx`, scaled by how far the cold front moves in `dt` hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage:\n",
    "This simple program can be used in educational settings to demonstrate basic principles of linear interpolation and applying rates over time, or in a basic meteorological context to estimate temperature changes without complex modeling. It is a straightforward example of applying basic physics and arithmetic operations in a programmatic context."
