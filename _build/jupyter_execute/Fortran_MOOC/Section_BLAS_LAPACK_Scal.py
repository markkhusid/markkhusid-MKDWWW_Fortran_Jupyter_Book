# ## This program demonstrates using the SCAL BLAS/LAPACK subroutine to scale a vector by a constant in Fortran.

# In file *section_blas_lapack_scal.f90*

# ```{literalinclude} Fortran_Code/Section_BLAS_LAPACK_Scal/app/section_blas_lapack_scal.f90
# ---
# language: fortran
# ---
# ```

# The above program is compiled and run using Fortran Package Manager (fpm):

# ## Build the Program using FPM (Fortran Package Manager)

# In[1]:


import os
root_dir = ""
root_dir = os.getcwd()


# Since the code makes use of the LAPACK library, the following FPM configuration file (fpm.toml) was used:

# ```{literalinclude} Fortran_Code/Section_BLAS_LAPACK_Scal/fpm.toml
# ---
# language: toml
# ---
# ```

# In[2]:


code_dir = root_dir + "/" + "Fortran_Code/Section_BLAS_LAPACK_Scal"


# In[3]:


os.chdir(code_dir)


# In[4]:


build_status = os.system("fpm build 2>/dev/null")


# ## Run the Program using FPM (Fortran Package Manager)

# In[5]:


exec_status = \
    os.system("fpm run 2>/dev/null")
