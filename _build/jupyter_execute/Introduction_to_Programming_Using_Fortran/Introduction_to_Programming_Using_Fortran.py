# # Worked Examples

# In this section we will be following along with the examples from "Introduction to Programming Using Fortran 95/2003/2008" by Ed Jorgensen (March 2018 / Version 3.0.51). We will use Jupyter Lab with the Fortran Package Manager (fpm) to facilitate creation of this Jupyter Book.
