    "The Fortran program named `cold_front` is designed to calculate and display the temperature at different time intervals as a cold front moves through a region, altering the temperature linearly based on its speed and the initial temperature gradient over a given distance. The core computation is encapsulated within a function `cold_front_temperature`, which calculates the resulting temperature after the cold front has affected the area for a specified duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Structure and Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Declarations:**\n",
    "   - `n`: An integer used as a counter in the loop to represent time in hours.\n",
    "   - `nhours`: A real number that converts `n` into a real data type appropriate for passing to the `cold_front_temperature` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop Execution:**\n",
    "   - The `do` loop runs from 6 to 48 hours in increments of 6 hours. For each iteration, it calculates the temperature after `nhours` using the `cold_front_temperature` function and prints the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Function Definition (`cold_front_temperature`):**\n",
    "   - **Input Parameters:**\n",
    "     - `temp1` (Real): The initial temperature at the starting point (e.g., 12 degrees Celsius).\n",
    "     - `temp2` (Real): The initial temperature at a distance `dx` from the starting point (e.g., 24 degrees Celsius).\n",
    "     - `c` (Real): The speed of the cold front in km/hr (e.g., 20 km/hr).\n",
    "     - `dx` (Real): The distance over which the initial temperature difference `temp2 - temp1` is observed (e.g., 960 km).\n",
    "     - `dt` (Real): The time in hours for which the effect of the cold front is being calculated (e.g., `nhours`).\n",
    "   - **Calculation and Result:**\n",
    "     - The formula `temp2 - c * (temp2 - temp1) / dx * dt` is used to calculate the temperature after the cold front has moved for `dt` hours. This calculation effectively adjusts the temperature at the point `temp2` by considering how the temperature gradient changes linearly with distance, scaled by the speed of the cold front and the time elapsed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function calculates the change in temperature as a function of time due to the movement of the cold front:\n",
    "  - `(temp2 - temp1) / dx` computes the rate of temperature change per kilometer (temperature gradient).\n",
    "  - Multiplying this gradient by the cold front's speed `c` gives the rate of temperature change per hour.\n",
    "  - Multiplying further by `dt` scales this hourly change by the number of hours `nhours` to determine the total change in temperature over that period.\n",
    "- The result is subtracted from `temp2` because as the cold front moves, it brings the characteristics (temperature) of the starting point (`temp1`) towards the point initially at `temp2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage and Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- The program is particularly useful for educational purposes or simple meteorological predictions to understand the impact of a moving cold front over time on the local temperature.\n",
    "- It provides a straightforward and clear output showing how the temperature changes every 6 hours from 6 to 48 hours as a cold front progresses through the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is an excellent example of using procedural abstraction (`cold_front_temperature` function) to encapsulate the logic for a specific calculation, making the main program more readable and easier to manage."
